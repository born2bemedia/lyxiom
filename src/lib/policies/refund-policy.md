At **Lyxiom LTD**, we are committed to providing a seamless and satisfying service experience. However, please note that we do not offer refunds if you are dissatisfied with the services, choose to stop using our services, or for any other reason unrelated to a technical issue or billing error.

## **Refund Eligibility Criteria**

Refunds will only be considered under the following circumstances:

### **Double or Multiple Charges Due to Technical Issues**

If your transaction was processed multiple times (e.g., 2X or 3X, the amount was withdrawn from your account) due to a technical glitch in the third-party payment system, bank, or payment processor, you may be eligible for a refund.

### **Overpayment Due to Personal Error**

If you mistakenly transferred an amount greater than what was issued in your invoice (e.g., you entered the wrong sum or paid more than required), you may request a refund for the excess amount.

## **How to Request a Refund**

**Submit a Refund Request**: Send your refund request to **\[\*\***Email Address\***\*\]** with the following details:

- Your full name

**Supporting Documents**: Be prepared to provide any additional documentation as requested to support your refund claim.

## **Refund Review Process**
